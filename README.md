# hello-word
Introductory repository creation to learn how to use github.

Hello, im Angel.

Currently in college, graduating in computer science very soon.

Ive developed an interest in server management, cloud computing, and software engineering.

Looking into data analysis, database management, cloud architecture, and cloud software engineering.

This journey will be a *tough* one, as im still learning about all the theory and practice of computer science, and all the nuances it comes with.

I will look back and this and reflect how much ive grown in this field.

Hope future me is giving great things in this field.

And to whoever else finds this and reads this, hello, and hope we meet soon.
